# NXT Museum

On Monday, 15th May 2023, I visited the [NXT Museum](https://nxtmuseum.com/) in Amsterdam with school.
The NXT museum holds exhibitions about new media and technology.
The museum challenges the open mind, as they say, and I am inclined to believe them, because I was exceptionally challenged trying to understand it.
I want make it clear that I am not writing this as a joke nor is any of it sarcastic.
Whatever I write here is my actual opinion and that comes from my actual observations from inside the museum.
I tried my best at interpreting the exhibitions and the opinions I have are a result of those interpretations, meaning that any other interpretation of the art exhibited inside the museum might lead to totally different opinions.

## You will never escape ads

I want to focus in particular on one exhibition by [Audrey Lange](http://audreylarge.com/) about a virtual changing room, where one can try clothes from the digital world.
In these digital mirrors, you're supposed to see yourself in a digital reality.
However, I couldn't really understand what "digital reality" was supposed to mean.
Does this mean that the digital world, like a virtual reality world, is actually a real world and should be interpreted as being real like our own?
Or does this mean it's an extension of the real world, where you can only see yourself, but not actually be?
Is seeing a reflection of yourself in there a sign to interpret that we can never enter the full digital world, or is it a limitation of our current technology?
Or does the sponsor of the camera filters that project the wild clothing on your body in the digital mirrors, Snapchat, have something to do with it?

That last part really stood out to me.
I am always skeptical of anything that a big company has a say in, and especially when that big company is a social media platform.
Being skeptical of those companies is something I have been for years.
I would never accept the sponsorship of a company that, among its fair share of controversies, actively provides the technology to enable a [phenomenon called 'Snapchat dysmorphia'](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/784563) where patients are seeking for plastic surgery to make themselves look like filtered version of themselves.
Yet here we are, advertising a company like that in a museum in probably the most progressive city in our country.
Here we are, advertising a company like that in an exhibition telling people they can look different "in a different world".

This "digital world" isn't a "different world", it's yet another way for social media companies to tell you you're ugly and to convince you that you have [body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder).

## But we have no trash tho

How does this exhibition try to justify this?
Why are we showing people the digital version of themselves, for any other reason than the one named above?
The exhibition tells you on a digital sign.
(The following part is a translation of the exhibition's digital display into English, the original picture can be seen in the footnotes) [^1]

```
The virtual changing room of The Fabricant once again reflects the capacity to choose your own reality.
By trying on digital fashion, you catch a glimpse of the possible versions of yourself in digital spheres.
This catwalk challenges you to abandon the limiting ideas about who you can be.
With digital layers you can explore looks that you may be to scared to try on in the 'real' world.
With clothing articles designed for individual style, rather than fashiontrends, they create no waste and other avatars can take them over when your identity evolves.
The possibilities are endless - so far as they reflect the identity you currently want to adopt.
``` 

To me, this is almost as good as admitting to the crime I accused them off earlier.  
*'By trying on digital fashion, you catch a glimpse of the possible versions of yourself in digital spheres. This catwalk challenges you to abandon the limiting ideas about who you can be. With digital layers you can explore looks that you may be to scared to try on in the 'real' world.'*.  
I meant it fully when I said that they are trying to give you body dysmorphic disorder and they are literally telling you here that you can look different and you might be too scared to try on different looks.

Next their justification: *'With clothing articles designed for individual style, rather than fashiontrends, they create no waste and other avatars can take them over when your identity evolves.'*.  
So that's it, creating no waste and being sustainable.

The reason for showing people a more ideal version of themselves; the reason to tell people they are too scared to try on new looks; the reason to shame people into not using Snapchat enough; it is **'We can do it without waste'**.  

## What should I think?

During the exhibition, I already joked with my friends about how awful I found this exhibition.
The corporate sponsor, the circlejerking around sustainability, etc.
But as I was thinking of writing this article, I found even more holes in the story.  
The university, the place for thought and reasoning, taking us to a place exhibiting (among other things) an elaborate advertisement for Snapchat?
The university, the place for acceptance and your own identity, taking us to a place where you're told you can be someone else and you don't have to be yourself?
The university, the place for rational thought, taking us to a place where you are told the "digital world" is another reality all the same?

The more I think about it, the more I feel disgusted.

To conclude, this exhibition is awful.
It's a corporate advertisment literally telling you you're ugly and should find a way to change yourself.
